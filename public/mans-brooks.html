    <h2>Men's BROOKS GHOST 15:</h2>
    <p>
        The same Ghost you love has been updated as the Men's Brooks Ghost 15;
         it's now lighter and more comfortable than ever. Thanks to a new midsole 
         featuring DNA Loft v2 cushioning, your daily trainer weighs 9.8 oz: that's 
         even less than the Ghost 14. An engineered air mesh upper is 3D printed to 
         ensure perfection and breathability. Start building up your mileage because 
         your Ghost 15 has High Performance Rubber in the heel for extra durable road 
         protection.
