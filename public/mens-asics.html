    <h2>Men's ASICS GEL-NIMBUS 25:</h2>
    <p>
        An up-tempo ride no matter how far you go. Your updated Men's ASICS GEL-Nimbus 25 running shoes boast the softest ride you've felt from this series with refreshed materials like new PureGEL® technology giving you more FF BLAST™ PLUS cushion to absorb impact for an ultra-bouncy ride. But that's not all. A breathable knit upper in the GEL-Nimbus 25 hugs your foot like your favorite pair of socks and new construction in the knit tongue enhance the flex and fit around your ankle.
